# Connect Four - AI Player
I worked on this project as part of the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence class at Northeastern, Spring 2023. We were tasked with creating a Connect Four AI for a class-wide competition using MinMax and whatever other enhancements we would find effective. The competition didn't materialize, but it was a fun project nonetheless.
